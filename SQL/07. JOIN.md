# JOIN
>두 개 이상의 테이블들을 연결 또는 결합하여 데이터를 출력하는 것을 말한다.

## INNER JOIN
> JOIN 조건에서 동일한 값이 있는 행만을 반환한한다.

#### 예시1
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
```

#### 예시2
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
```

<br>

## OUTER JOIN
>INNER JOIN을 제외한 모든 JOIN은 OUTER JOIN이다.

### LEFT JOIN
A값의 전체와, A의 KEY 값과 B KEY 값이 같은 결과를 리턴한다.

#### 예시1
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID
--모든 고객을 출력하는데 주문한 기록이 있던 고객은 주문기록도 출력
```

#### 예시2
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID
WHERE OrderID IS NUL
-- 주문한 기록이 없는 고객들만 출력
-- Orders 테이블의 값들은 CustomerID 빼고 다 NULL
```

<br>

### RIGHT JOIN
B값의 전체와, B의 KEY 값과 A KEY 값이 같은 결과를 리턴한다.
LEFT JOIN에서 테이블 순서를 바꾼 것과 일치하기 때문에 잘 사용하지 않는다.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/8342/1449769013-e54ce90480-Country.jpg"></img>

```sql
SELECT city.name
FROM city
INNER JOIN country ON city.countrycode = country.code
WHERE country.continent = 'Africa'
```

<br>

## Q2. Population Census

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

table은 Q1과 동일

```sql
SELECT SUM(city.population)
FROM city
INNER JOIN country ON city.countrycode = country.code
WHERE country.continent = 'Asia'
```

<br>

## Q3. Average Population of Each Continent
Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.
Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

table은 Q1과 동일

```sql
SELECT country.continent, FLOOR(AVG(city.population))
FROM city
INNER JOIN country ON city.countrycode = country.code
GROUP BY country.continent
```

## Q4. Customers Who Never Order
```
Table: Customers
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+

customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 
Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

## Q6.
 Rising Temperature
```
Table: Weather
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 
Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |

+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```
```sql
SELECT today.id
FROM Weather AS today
